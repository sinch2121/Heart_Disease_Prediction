Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project is a web-based application built using Streamlit that predicts the risk of heart disease based on user-provided medical information. The application uses a machine learning model trained on a healthcare dataset to make accurate predictions.

🚀 Features:
1. User-friendly interface for inputting health parameters

2. Real-time heart disease risk prediction

3. Visual representation of prediction probabilities using bar plots

4. Feature importance visualization for model interpretability

🛠️ Technologies Used:
1. Python

2. Streamlit

3. NumPy

4. Pandas

5. Matplotlib & Seaborn

6. Joblib (for model serialization)

7. Scikit-Learn (for machine learning)

📊 How It Works:
1. Users enter medical details such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

2. The pre-trained machine learning model predicts the likelihood of heart disease.

3. Visualizations provide insights into the prediction and model behavior.
